In June of 2022, I finished my first [Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) Data Science Boot Camp. During the boot camp I completed a data science project to predict which films would be nominated for the Best Animate Feature Film Academy Award.

The following presentation was given to the Erdos Institute to fullfil the requirements of the boot camp.
