<h3>Predicting Academy Award Winners</h3>
The Academy Award for "Best Animated Feature Film", first introduced at the 74th Academy Awards is a prestigious award. Even being nominated is great, and it benefits directors, production companies, etc. because it attracts more talent, earns more at the box office, and in general increases awareness about a movie and the people who worked on it.

The goal of our project is to create a model that can 'predict' whether an animated film will be nominated for Best Animated Feature Film or not.

This project was [presented](https://ruggiec.github.io/jekyll/update/2022/12/14/spring-2022-erdos-institute-project.html) to the Erdos Institute Spring 2022 Boot Camp.
